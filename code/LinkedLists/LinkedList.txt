Static Memory Allocation
    memory allocation is done during compile time
    it remains fixed
    lacks flexibility
    could result in memory wastage
    hence inefficient
    
Dynamic Memory Allocation
    memory allocation is done during run time
    on demand - on the fly
    memory grows and shrink dynamically
    efficient usage of memory
    
    
    
    malloc
    calloc
    realloc
    
    free
